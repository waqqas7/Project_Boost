## Background
This is the [Complete Unity C# Developer 3D](http://gdev.tv/cu2github), the long-awaited sequel to the [Complete Unity C# Developer 2D](http://gdev.tv/cudgithub) - one of the most successful e-learning courses on the internet! Completely re-worked from scratch with brand-new projects, our latest teaching techniques,. You will benefit from the fact we have already taught over 350,000 students game development, many shipping commercial games as a result.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files! The real value is in our huge, high-quality online tutorials that accompany this repo. You can check out the course here: [Complete Unity C# Developer 3D](http://gdev.tv/cu2github)

## Project Pre-requisites
In order to start this section you should have either finished [the previous section of this course](https://github.com/CompleteUnityDeveloper2/2_Terminal_Hacker), or be able to complete it's learning outcomes.

# Project 3 - Project Boost
This is a game inspired by the 1986 classic Thrust. The goal is to battle gravity and avoid obstacles to skillfully pilot your ship from a launch pad to a landing pad. A simple concept with a huge array of gameplay opportunities.

## This Project's Learning Outcomes
Basic Particle Effects. Local version control. Create C# scripts. Add Unity Components. Use coordinate systems, origins and anchor points. Create and maniplulate Unity prefabs. Do basic level design. (Ref: PB_CU2)

## How To Build / Compile
This is a Unity project. If you're familiar with source control, then "clone this repo". Otherwise download the contents, and navigate to `Assets > Levels` then open any `.unity` file.

This branch is the course branch, each commit corresponds to a lecture in the course. The current state is our latest progress.
